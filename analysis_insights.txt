Data Description: Each row represents a charging session with details like Session ID, Charger ID, Seller ID, Minutes charged, Watt hours charged, Start time, and Stop time.

Data Cleaning: Removed invalid values (future start times, negative watt hours) and populated missing end times.

Transformation: Raw data is converted into hourly time series.

Seasonality: Weekly patterns observed; highest demand on Mondays, weekdays higher than weekends.

Feature Engineering: Created variables from DATETIME field:
    - day_of_week (0-6)
    - hour_of_day (0-23)
    - is_weekend (binary)

Machine Learning: Data split 80:20 for training/testing. Models used:
    - Decision Tree Regressor
    - Random Forest
    - Gradient Boosting
    - Neural Networks (with grid search)
    
Evaluation: Models evaluated using RMSE and R-square. Best model forecasts next week's energy consumption. Results available in the dashboard.
